# oci_disaster_recovery_dr_plan_execution
This resource provides the Dr Plan Execution resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Disaster Recovery service.

Execute a DR Plan for a DR Protection Group.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_disaster_recovery_dr_plan_execution" "test_dr_plan_execution" {
	#Required
	execution_options {
		#Required
		plan_execution_type = var.dr_plan_execution_execution_options_plan_execution_type

		#Optional
		are_prechecks_enabled = var.dr_plan_execution_execution_options_are_prechecks_enabled
		are_warnings_ignored = var.dr_plan_execution_execution_options_are_warnings_ignored
	}
	plan_id = oci_disaster_recovery_plan.test_plan.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = var.dr_plan_execution_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the DR Plan Execution.  Example: `Execution - EBS Switchover PHX to IAD` 
* `execution_options` - (Required) The options for a plan execution.
	* `are_prechecks_enabled` - (Applicable when plan_execution_type=FAILOVER | SWITCHOVER) A flag indicating whether prechecks should be executed before the plan execution.  Example: `false` 
	* `are_warnings_ignored` - (Optional) A flag indicating whether warnings should be ignored during the switchover precheck.  Example: `true` 
	* `plan_execution_type` - (Required) The type of the plan execution. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `plan_id` - (Required) The OCID of the DR Plan.  Example: `ocid1.drplan.oc1.iad.&lt;unique_id&gt;` 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
