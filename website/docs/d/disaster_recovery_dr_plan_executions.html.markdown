## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_disaster_recovery_dr_plan_executions" "test_dr_plan_executions" {
	#Required
	dr_protection_group_id = oci_disaster_recovery_dr_protection_group.test_dr_protection_group.id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.dr_plan_execution_display_name
	dr_plan_execution_id = oci_disaster_recovery_dr_plan_execution.test_dr_plan_execution.id
	dr_plan_execution_type = var.dr_plan_execution_dr_plan_execution_type
	state = var.dr_plan_execution_state
}
```
